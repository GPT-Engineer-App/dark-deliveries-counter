# dark-deliveries-counter

The website should have a dark-themed header with navigation links that include 'Download app', 'About Airmee', 'Sustainability', 'For retailers', 'Airmee careers', 'For carriers', and 'Support'. There should be a large, bold counter on the website showcasing a delivery number, e.g., '21,042,391 deliveries. And counting.' The counter should be prominently displayed against a backdrop of stacked parcels. The parcels should have a realistic look, with labels, barcodes, and varied hues of white and brown, some with blue striping, signifying branding or packing tape. The overall color scheme is dark and muted, with the parcels themselves providing a contrast. The typography for the counter should be modern and easily readable. Ensure that the layout is clean, with ample negative space around the counter to draw focus to it. The UI should be sleek and professional, catering to a logistics or delivery service audience.
